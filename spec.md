# Caffeine Tracker Web App: Developer Specification

---

## 1. Introduction

This document details the requirements and architectural choices for a caffeine tracking web application, built using Next.js. The application allows users to log their daily caffeine intake, visualize consumption trends, manage a personalized and shared drink database, and configure personal limits. The app supports both anonymous guest users and authenticated email users with seamless data linking.

## 3. Technical Architecture âœ… IMPLEMENTED

* **Frontend:** Next.js 15+ with App Router
* **Backend/API:** tRPC with Next.js App Router
* **Database:** SQLite (development/testing) with Prisma ORM
* **Authentication:** NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js) with:
    * Email magic links via Resend
    * Anonymous credentials provider for guest users
    * JWT session strategy
    * Prisma adapter for database integration

---

## 4. Data Model (Prisma Schema) âœ… IMPLEMENTED

The database schema uses Prisma and includes support for both authenticated and anonymous users:

* **User**: Stores core user information
    * **Fields**: `id` (unique identifier), `email` (nullable for anonymous users), `isGuest` (boolean), `name`, `emailVerified`, `image`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
    * **Relations**: Has relationships to `Account`, `Session`, `UserFavorite`, `CaffeineEntry`, and `UserDailyLimit`
    * **Anonymous Users**: Users with `isGuest: true` and `email: null`

* **UserFavorite**: Represents user's favorite drinks for quick access âœ… IMPLEMENTED
    * **Fields**: `id`, `userId`, `name`, `caffeineMg`, `createdAt`
    * **Constraints**: Unique constraint on `userId`, `name`, and `caffeineMg` combination

* **CaffeineEntry**: Self-contained record of caffeine consumption âœ… IMPLEMENTED
    * **Fields**: `id`, `userId` (links to a User), `consumedAt` (timestamp), `name` (snapshot of drink name or manual description), `caffeineMg` (snapshot of caffeine amount), `createdAt`
    * **Indexing**: Indexed on `userId` and `consumedAt` for fast lookups
    * **Note**: Uses snapshot fields instead of linking to a separate Drink model

* **UserDailyLimit**: History of user's daily caffeine limits âœ… IMPLEMENTED
    * **Fields**: `id`, `userId` (links to a User), `limitMg`, `effectiveFrom` (date limit became active), `createdAt`
    * **Constraints**: One limit change per timestamp (`effectiveFrom`)

* **Account, Session, VerificationToken**: Standard NextAuth.js models for authentication âœ… IMPLEMENTED

## 5. Authentication Flow âœ… IMPLEMENTED

### 5.1 Anonymous User Creation
* Automatic creation of anonymous users via NextAuth.js CredentialsProvider
* Anonymous users receive a unique session ID and can use all app features
* Data is stored and associated with the anonymous user ID

### 5.2 Guest to Authenticated User Linking âœ… IMPLEMENTED
* When a guest user signs in with email, the system:
    1. Creates a new authenticated user account
    2. Transfers all associated data (entries, drinks, limits) to the new account
    3. Deletes the anonymous user account
    4. Maintains data integrity throughout the process
* This process is atomic and handles edge cases gracefully

### 5.3 Session Management âœ… IMPLEMENTED
* JWT-based sessions for both guest and authenticated users
* Automatic session refresh and persistence
* Secure session invalidation on sign-out

---

## 6. API (tRPC Procedures) âœ… IMPLEMENTED

The API is implemented using tRPC with all procedures requiring an authenticated session (guest or email).

* **`user` router** âœ… IMPLEMENTED
    * `me: query` - Fetches profile data for the current user

* **`settings` router** âœ… IMPLEMENTED
    * `getLimit: query` - Retrieves current and historical daily limits
    * `setLimit: mutation` - Sets new daily caffeine limit

* **`favorites` router** âœ… IMPLEMENTED
    * `add: mutation` - Adds new favorite drink for current user
    * `remove: mutation` - Removes favorite drink for current user

* **`entries` router** âœ… IMPLEMENTED
    * `create: mutation` - Creates new caffeine entry (preset or manual)
    * `update: mutation` - Updates existing caffeine entry
    * `delete: mutation` - Deletes caffeine entry
    * `list: query` - Gets paginated list of entries
    * `getDaily: query` - Gets all entries for specific day
    * `getSuggestions: query` - Gets drink suggestions from favorites and history

## 11. Key Design Decisions

### 11.1 Simplified Data Model
The current implementation uses a simplified approach where:
- Caffeine entries store snapshot data (name, caffeine amount) rather than linking to a separate Drink model
- User favorites provide quick access to frequently used drinks
- This approach reduces complexity while maintaining data integrity

### 11.2 Guest User Support
The app prioritizes immediate usability by:
- Automatically creating anonymous sessions for new users
- Allowing full functionality without registration
- Providing seamless data migration to authenticated accounts

### 11.3 TypeScript-First Development
The entire codebase uses strict TypeScript with:
- Comprehensive type definitions
- Zod schema validation
- tRPC for type-safe API calls
